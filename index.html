            <p>Plant a green tree and live younger. Save a tree and save the air from pollution. Protect your Earth, Protect the Greenery. Help the birds build a nest, plant a tree.Trees reduce the 'Greenhouse' effect by removing carbon dioxide from the air and releasing oxygen. Each year a mature tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people. Trees are also an effective sound barrier and can limit noise pollution. Recent research shows that trees also help reduce the stress of modern life.</p>
